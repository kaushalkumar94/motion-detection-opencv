# ️Motion Detection Using OpenCV — From Basics to Real-World Impact

 **"Ever wondered how CCTV cameras detect motion and start recording only when something moves?"**

Motion detection is no longer just a cool tech trick — it's at the heart of smart surveillance, wildlife monitoring, home security, self-driving cars, and more. This project demonstrates how you can build your own real-time motion detection system using **Python** and **OpenCV**.

 

## Real-World Applications

- **Home Security** – Start recording when motion is detected.
- **Self-driving Cars** – Detect objects moving into the vehicle’s path.
- **Wildlife Monitoring** – Capture animal movement remotely.
- **Factory Automation** – Identify unusual movement on production lines.
- **Gesture Recognition** – Detect hand or body motion in games or interfaces.

 

##  Project Features

- Detects motion in webcam video feed
- Shows bounding boxes around moving objects
- Allows snapshot saving (`s` key)
- Can reset background frame (`r` key)
- Logs motion events with timestamp
